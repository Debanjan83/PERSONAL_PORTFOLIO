                    I am a <span className="font-semibold text-purple-600">passionate web developer </span>
                    with a strong foundation in designing and building modern, responsive, and dynamic web applications.
                    Over time, I have worked on projects that not only enhanced my technical expertise but also
                    strengthened my problem-solving and analytical thinking abilities.

                    My core skills include <span className="font-semibold">Full Stack Development</span>,
                    where I actively work with <span className="font-semibold">Java, C, and modern web frameworks </span>
                    to craft scalable, user-friendly, and high-performance solutions. Beyond coding,
                    I have a keen interest in <span className="font-semibold">UI/UX design</span>, ensuring that
                    every application I create is not only functional but also intuitive and visually appealing.

                    I thrive in environments where I can collaborate, brainstorm innovative ideas, and
                    continuously explore new technologies. My ultimate goal is to contribute to impactful
                    projects that make a difference, while consistently sharpening my skills
                    and pushing the boundaries of what I can achieve as a developer. ðŸš€
